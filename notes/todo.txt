- selectAllMachine
- See if there's a way to re-use machines with assigned actions
- Move modal to use toggleMachine
  - We might need a way to prefix -> modal.active, modal.inactive
  - And then a way for the route to infer the prefixed event

- Setup debug logging ?debug

- I shouldn't have to set the machine.id to match the route
  - Allow doing it via spawnMachine on router.machine

spawnMachine should require a list of events that get passed to the child
Either: 
- Move sync to spawnMachine as a '*' listener via withConfig, then convert from '*' to list of keys provided, if that works
Otherwise
- When actor is saved to ref, store list of keys in it, then check for it in sync '*'

- Build the modal exercise
  - I want a way to just have route specific state
    - In this case I want select all to be route specific, not in the store
  - Move createListItem to pizza route machine
  - Hash out simple machine, then extract to list and price if needed:
    - Set up list machine and price machine
