- Setup / example using route and components
  - Server and client examples (JS and no-js)
- Server render / and add to readme (client and server rendering)

- Simulate adding a post

- Sharing state between routes
  - Render a second page with the count

  Some options:
  - Current route calls nextRoute with appropriate state, which then calls onEnter
  - onEnter has access to state
  - Global store

- Allow actions
- Allow using machines
- Ability to go from update -> createMachine

- Front end deploy to pages
- Server deploy to workers

Later
- Setup node vite plugin so node updates trigger a hot module reload
- Try miniflare instead of wrangler? Or just wait until js api is supported in wrangler
