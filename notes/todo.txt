- Setup single store for all routes
- See if you can get the UI to work on both the server and UI
  - Switch to calling API for making updates, client can use hono directly
- See if you can set up hono on client

- Setup db/store object and req obj for each route

- Instead of actions living in the route
  - UI calls API
  - The api updates the global db and responds
  - UI requests new json once request completes
    - Each route has access to req, db, user
  - See if you can Hono to work locally as well as server
  - Each route should get req, db, user
    - req: hono req
    - db: all state stored in memory
    - user: user data
  - Server
    - routes
    - components  



- Render a second page with the prev routes posts

  Some options:
  - Current route calls nextRoute with appropriate state, which then calls onEnter
  - onEnter has access to state
  - Global store

- Array support for routes names ['', '/']
- Server render / and add to readme (client and server rendering)
- Use a machine instead of reducer

Then
- Add error boundary
- File typescript bug for object spread

- Write an eslint plugin to require a catch block for async
- Add type builder for hono

- Allow actions
- Allow using machines
- Ability to go from update -> createMachine

- Front end deploy to pages
- Server deploy to workers


V2
- Rewrite types from scratch


- Setup time travel debugging
- Add a check for combining reducers, making sure duplicate actions aren't used
- Ability to create sub routes
  - Essentially I can break out an existing route, create a new one and have it be used
    - I will have to think about how this would work with send
    - Either via passing the prop to the component, or potentially having sub routes via the url, that then direct where they are sent
      /home
      /home/posts
  - Ability to createRenderer in render function

Later
- Setup node vite plugin so node updates trigger a hot module reload
- Try miniflare instead of wrangler? Or just wait until js api is supported in wrangler
