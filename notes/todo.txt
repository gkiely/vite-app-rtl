- Type actions/payloads
  - Should be able to determine payload based on the action
  - It should be typed in the route
- Sharing state between routes
  - Render a second page with the count

  Some options:
  - Current route calls nextRoute with appropriate state, which then calls onEnter
  - onEnter has access to state
  - Global store

- Array support for routes names ['', '/']
- Server render / and add to readme (client and server rendering)
- Use a machine instead of reducer

Then
- Add error boundary
- File typescript bug for object spread

- Write an eslint plugin to require a catch block for async
- Add type builder for hono

- Allow actions
- Allow using machines
- Ability to go from update -> createMachine

- Front end deploy to pages
- Server deploy to workers


V2
- Rewrite types from scratch


- Setup time travel debugging
- Add a check for combining reducers, making sure duplicate actions aren't used
- Ability to create sub routes
  - Essentially I can break out an existing route, create a new one and have it be used
    - I will have to think about how this would work with send
    - Either via passing the prop to the component, or potentially having sub routes via the url, that then direct where they are sent
      /home
      /home/posts
  - Ability to createRenderer in render function

Later
- Setup node vite plugin so node updates trigger a hot module reload
- Try miniflare instead of wrangler? Or just wait until js api is supported in wrangler
