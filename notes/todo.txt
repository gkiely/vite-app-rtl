- Add typing for promise
https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/45602
interface Promise<T> {
  /**
   * Attaches a callback for only the rejection of the Promise.
   * @param onrejected The callback to execute when the Promise is rejected.
   * @returns A Promise for the completion of the callback.
   */
  catch<TResult = never>(
    onrejected?: ((reason: unknown) => TResult | PromiseLike<TResult>) | undefined | null,
  ): Promise<T | TResult>;
}

- If update is a function, it acts as normal
  - If it's an object, it updates partially the same as setState did
- Simulate adding a post
- Setup / example using route and components
  - Server and client examples (JS and no-js)

- See if there's a way to use react hooks, in a route, it would be useful

- Setup routes
  - Use SDUI for V1
- Front end deploy to pages
- Server deploy to workers

Later
- Setup node vite plugin so updates trigger a hot module reload
- Try miniflare instead of wrangler? Or just wait until js api is supported in wrangler
