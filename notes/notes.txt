Routing
Option 1: SDUI
- All routes are rendered by default
- clicking on something is like clicking on a link
  - Route automatically requests next route
  - Could use service workers or not
- Use server push to update UI

Option 2: new-architecture
- createRoute
  - Every interaction goes through route
  - Uses xstate to handle the states, requests
  - Could use service workers or not
